    The blackberry is actually an aggregate fruit which is consisting of some smaller fruits known as drupes.
The fruit is extremely dark purple and has a smooth,delicate skin. The blackberry contains a greenish-white 
core which reaches near the bottom. Blackberries are usually wrongly identified as raspberries. However, 
raspberries contain a hollow center. When raw, blackberries are red in color and hard, and change to black and 
shiny once they ripen.The blackberry tree has a number of long, trailing or arching stems (known as canes). 
The berries are grown on two year-old canes. The blackberry may reach as high as 10 feet.The canes are pale
green with thorns; even so, you may find thornless speciesThe leaves of blackberry are structured alternately
along the cane and each and every leaf comprises 3-5 leaflets.The compound leaves can be seen intensely toothed
along the edges, fairly prickly, and in bright green.
